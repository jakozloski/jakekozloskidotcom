                    <p>Keeper's Vision: Revolutionize matchmaking by providing guaranteed, criteria-based matches through increasingly affordable AI-driven solutions, ultimately enabling everyone on Earth to find lasting love.</p>

                    <p>I'm Jake Kozloski, CEO and Founder of Keeper. My favorite companies are ones that communicate a clear vision of how they'll improve the trajectory of humanity and outline a path for how to get there. SpaceX, OpenAI, and Tesla are a few that set this example. Keeper is no different. I want to outline Keeper's vision for you, taking inspiration from Musk's iconic Tesla Master Plan.</p>

                    <p>Keeper's first product is a premium, high-touch matchmaking service. We facilitate romantic connections where each person meets <strong>all</strong> of each other's stated criteria for a long-term partner. Clients sign a bounty contract to receive matches (one at a time), with full payment upon marriage or a common law equivalent.</p>

                    <p>No other matchmaker offers 100% criteria matching, let alone an incentive-aligned payment structure. Existing matchmaking services are low-tech, inefficient, and misaligned with client interests, preferring volume over quality. Meanwhile dating apps flood you with countless incompatible matches, rarely leading to meaningful relationships. Keeper prioritizes quality over quantity, ensuring matches meet your preferences completely, because genuine compatibility is critical for lasting love.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p><strong>Our mission is ambitious: Build an AI-driven matchmaking system capable of providing everyone their ideal match—accessible and affordable worldwide.</strong> A match for everyone, and for everyone a match. More happy families, more love shared.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>We're in a fertility crisis fueled by a marriage crisis that jeopardizes the future of humanity itself. Our mission is to address this crisis head-on by reversing the decades-long trend against marriage and family-formation.</p>

                    <p>Our first task is to be the world's most effective matchmaker, which is why Keeper is designed to beat traditional high-end matchmakers head-to-head. But we're not making another matchmaking service. We're making the best possible matchmaking service, as just a step in our mission.</p>

                    <p>Keeper's strategy is to enter the high end of the market where customers pay a premium, then we expand downmarket, achieving higher unit volume, lower unit cost, and lower prices with each successive product iteration.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The second major iteration of Keeper will offer <strong>the same 100% criteria matchmaking at roughly 1/10th the price.</strong> The third will be instantaneous and not require humans in the loop at all.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>As a rapidly growing tech company, Keeper reinvests all free cash flow into product development, driving down costs, increasing scale, and accelerating improvements. Today's premium customers aren't just investing in their personal futures; they're enabling Keeper's mission to benefit everyone.</p>

                    <p>We often hear two protests against using technology to create romance, "attraction isn't a math problem" and "dating apps discourage long-term relationships."</p>

                    <p>To the first — attraction is a series of conscious and subconscious evaluations your brain makes about another person. These evaluations are based on a long list of criteria ingrained by your biology and upbringing. The preferences and traits you value in the person you're looking for are recordable and measurable.</p>

                    <p>In the past, intermediaries like friends, family, and matchmakers would introduce you to a compatible partner using judgement based on intimate knowledge about both of you. Today, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision algorithms can make these inferences <em><strong>more accurately and efficiently</strong></em> than traditional intermediaries.</p>

                    <p>With enough information about two people and their preferences, creating a match is straightforward. Mass cynicism about existing dating apps is due to the fact that no product before Keeper has matched users based on <strong>all</strong> of their expressed and unexpressed preferences. Very few people have experienced what it's like to match with someone who is actually everything they have always wanted.</p>

                    <p>To the second argument: Yes, every <em>current</em> dating product creates poor incentives. Here's how we're fixing those broken incentives:</p>

                    <p><strong>Current Options:</strong> Only let you filter on about a dozen criteria, leaving you to sift through a deluge of incompatible matches and distracting you with fleeting relationships along the way.</p>

                    <p><strong>Keeper:</strong> Lets you filter on every criteria your heart desires and matches you only with people who fit 100%.</p>

                    <p><strong>Current Options:</strong> Present limited information about each person, placing photos front-and-center. By reducing people to their appearances, they create a Pareto distribution where a few men receive almost all of the female attention (and vice-versa) - to a much greater extent than what's natural.</p>

                    <p><strong>Keeper:</strong> Looks matter, but so do hundreds of other things. Keeper presents you as a whole person, including everything that's important for evaluating a long-term partner.</p>

                    <p><strong>Current Options:</strong> Obfuscate intentions and allow people seeking short-term relationships, even on "serious relationship apps."</p>

                    <p><strong>Keeper:</strong> Everyone on Keeper is looking for a serious relationship. Anyone who isn't gets the boot.</p>

                    <p><strong>Current Options:</strong> Uniform and unisex user profiles ignoring individual preferences, sex differences, and the nuances of attraction psychology.</p>

                    <p><strong>Keeper:</strong> Profiles are sex-differentiated and tailored to each user's preferences, emphasizing the traits that each individual cares about the most.</p>

                    <p><strong>Current Options:</strong> Don't account for the different standards men have for short-term and long-term mates. Women will often match with a man thinking they meet his long-term standards, while he's only considering her for a short-term fling. This creates frustration for women and distraction for men.</p>

                    <p><strong>Keeper:</strong> Captures everyone's preferences for a long-term partner up front and only matches you with someone who fits the bill 100%, preventing short-term mate-seeking behavior.</p>

                    <p><strong>Current Options:</strong> Let you date several people at a time, making everyone feel less valued and more disposable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Keeper:</strong> One ultra-high-quality match at a time. If you are not interested in your match, we'll let them know and try again.</p>

                    <p>So, in short, the master plan is:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Build high-end matchmaking service with guaranteed 100% criteria matching and aligned incentives for finding every user a spouse.</li>
                        <li>Use that money to build a more affordable, productized, semi-automated matchmaking service with the same guaranteed 100% criteria matching.</li>
                        <li>Use <em><strong>that money</strong></em> to build a fully-automated matchmaking service that finds every user love on the first try.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>While doing the above, provide best-in-class guidance and feedback to people on how to improve themselves to increase their attractiveness in the eyes of their ideal partner.</p>

                    <p>We hope you'll join us on this journey.</p>
